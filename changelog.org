#+AUTHOR: Nicholas Glazer
#+DATE: 2025-07-09

* [Unreleased]
** Known Issues
*** Repository Management
- Files extracting to root instead of staying in ~/.miozu/
- Install script needs to work properly when run from miozu/ directory
- Symlink process putting files in wrong locations

*** Doom Emacs Theme Installation
- Theme cloning creates recursive structure in themes/
- Directory structure issues preventing proper theme access
- Target location should be ~/.config/doom/themes/miozu/

*** Missing System Services
- systemd-resolved.service not enabled by default
- systemd-networkd.service not enabled by default

** Planned Fixes
*** Repository Management Improvements
- Modify handle_miozu_repo() function to check if running from miozu/ directory
- If ~/.miozu doesn't exist, rename current dir to ~/.miozu
- If ~/.miozu exists, cd there and git pull instead of extracting files
- Fix setup_dotfiles() function to ensure symlinks are created correctly
- Prevent files from being copied to root directory

*** Doom Emacs Theme Installation Fixes
- Correct doom theme cloning path to ~/.config/doom/themes/miozu/
- Fix recursive directory creation issue
- Ensure theme files are accessible to doom emacs

*** System Services Enhancement
- Add systemd-resolved.service to configure_services()
- Add systemd-networkd.service to configure_services()
- Ensure both services are enabled and started automatically
