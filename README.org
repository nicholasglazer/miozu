* About
Miozu is a comprehensive Linux desktop environment configuration focused on productivity, aesthetics, and performance. Built for Arch Linux and designed around XMonad window manager, it creates a cohesive, keyboard-driven computing experience.

This configuration is inspired by the great Arch Linux community and serves as both a personal setup and a reference implementation for modern tiling window manager workflows.

It is also a part of [[https://github.com/nicholasglazer/arch-cheat-sheet][arch-cheat-sheet]] repository.

** Design Philosophy
- *Keyboard-centric workflow*: Minimize mouse dependency for maximum efficiency
- *Consistency*: Unified theming across all applications using the Miozu color scheme
- *Performance*: Lightweight components chosen for speed and resource efficiency
- *Modularity*: Configuration split into logical, maintainable modules
- *Extensibility*: Easy to customize and extend for personal preferences

** Terminal Multiplexer Research & Future Plans
*** Current Analysis:
The project currently uses individual terminal scratchpads in XMonad, but there's potential to create a more integrated terminal session management system.

*** Tmux Alternatives Evaluated:
- *Zellij* (Rust-based): Modern UI with built-in keybinding hints, plugin system
- *WezTerm* (Rust-based): GPU-accelerated with built-in multiplexing
- *GNU Screen*: Lightweight, traditional approach

*** XMonad-Based Terminal Multiplexer Concept:
Potential to develop a custom solution leveraging XMonad's Haskell ecosystem:
- Native integration with XMonad's window management
- Haskell-based configuration for type safety and expressiveness  
- Custom layouts optimized for terminal workflows
- Session persistence through XMonad's state management
- Integration with existing scratchpad system

*** Implementation Approaches:
1. *Pure Haskell*: Custom terminal multiplexer written in Haskell
2. *Rust Integration*: Extend existing Rust tools (Zellij/WezTerm) with XMonad bindings
3. *Hybrid Approach*: Enhanced XMonad configuration with tmux/zellij integration
